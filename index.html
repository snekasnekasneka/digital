    <p>The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum located on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife of three, Mumtaz Mahal.</p>

    <h2>Facts about Taj Mahal</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan, who was grieving the death of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz Mahal was his third wife, who died while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum!</li>
      <li>The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia, and over 1000 elephants were used to transport it. What more! Twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble!</li>
      <li>During the revolt of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers. They ripped off precious stones and lapis lazuli from the walls.</li>
      <li>The main chambers at Taj Mahal house the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The actual graves are at a lower level. Islam forbids elaborate decoration of graves, which is why the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right and towards Mecca.</li>
      <li>The four minarets at Taj Mahal were constructed slightly outside the plinth. The reason for this is, in case of an earthquake or any kind of collapse, the pillars would fall away from the tomb.</li>
